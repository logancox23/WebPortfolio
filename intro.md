For my Web Portfolio, I plan on including my projects from the class along with graphics and video edits I have made, as my target audience for my website is people in the digital media field. My goal is to make a professional looking website, that is easy to navigate and visually pleasing. I will accomplish this by making sure the website does not cluttered and all the colors of the site itself mesh well together. I problem I will face during the process of creating this website is trying to find a way to display my video edits on the website so that viewers can watch them without having to leave the website.
